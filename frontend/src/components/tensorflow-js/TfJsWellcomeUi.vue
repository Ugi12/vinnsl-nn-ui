      <!--TensorFlow.js is a library for developing and training ML models in JavaScript, and deploying in browser or on Node.js  (more details coming...) -->

      TensorFlow.js is a library for building and executing machine learning algorithms in JavaScript.
      TensorFlow.js models run in a web browser and in the Node.js environment.
      The library is part of the TensorFlow ecosystem, providing a set of APIs that are compatible with those in Python,
      allowing models to be ported between the Python and JavaScript ecosystems. TensorFlow.js has empowered a new set of
      developers from the extensive JavaScript community to build and deploy machine learning models and enabled new classes of on-device computation.
